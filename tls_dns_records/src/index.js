/**
 * DNS Records
 * DNS records are the available DNS addresses that can be used to enable TLS for a domain. DNS must be configured for a domain for TLS handshakes to succeed. If enabling TLS on an apex domain (e.g., `example.com`) you must create four A records (or four AAAA records for IPv6 support) using the displayed global A record's IP addresses with your DNS provider. For subdomains and wildcard domains (e.g., `www.example.com` or `*.example.com`) you will need to create a relevant CNAME record.
