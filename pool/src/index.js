/**
 * Pool
 * A pool is responsible for balancing requests among a group of servers. In addition to balancing, pools can be configured to attempt retrying failed requests. Pools have a quorum setting that can be used to determine when the pool as a whole is considered up, in order to prevent problems following an outage as servers come back up.
