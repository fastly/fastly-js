/**
 * Backend
 * A backend (also sometimes called an origin server) is a server identified by IP address or hostname, from which Fastly will fetch your content. There can be multiple backends attached to a service, but each backend is specific to one service. By default, the first backend added to a service configuration will be used for all requests (provided it meets any [conditions](/reference/api/vcl-services/condition) attached to it). If multiple backends are defined for a service, the first one that has no attached conditions, or whose condition is satisfied for the current request, will be used, unless that behavior is modified using the `auto_loadbalance` field described below.
